## Introduction
This notebook is designed to help you understand how to implement and fine-tune an XGBoost model with cost complexity pruning. Additionally, it includes steps for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `altair`
- `scipy`
- `xgboost`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
